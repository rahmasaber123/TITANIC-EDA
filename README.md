# 🛳 Titanic Survival Prediction – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Overview  
The Titanic dataset is one of the most iconic datasets in data science, often used for beginner-to-intermediate machine learning and analysis tasks.  
In this project, I performed a **comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to investigate survival patterns across various demographic and social features such as **gender, passenger class, age, and family size**.  

---

## Objectives  
- Clean and prepare the Titanic dataset for analysis.  
- Perform univariate and bivariate analysis to understand survival distribution.  
- Visualize data trends using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.  
- Apply **feature engineering** such as encoding categorical variables.  
- Extract insights about how **gender, class, and age influenced survival**.

## 🔍 Insights & Findings  
- Women were much more likely to survive (`~74%`) compared to men (`~19%`).  
- First-class passengers had significantly higher survival rates than third-class.
