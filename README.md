# ðŸ›³ Titanic Survival Prediction â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Overview  
The Titanic dataset is one of the most iconic datasets in data science, often used for beginner-to-intermediate machine learning and analysis tasks.  
In this project, I performed a **comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to investigate survival patterns across various demographic and social features such as **gender, passenger class, age, and family size**.  

---

## Objectives  
- Clean and prepare the Titanic dataset for analysis.  
- Perform univariate and bivariate analysis to understand survival distribution.  
- Visualize data trends using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.  
- Apply **feature engineering** such as encoding categorical variables.  
- Extract insights about how **gender, class, and age influenced survival**.

##  Tools & Libraries  
- **Pandas** â†’ Data wrangling and cleaning  
- **NumPy** â†’ Numerical computations  
- **Matplotlib** â†’ Basic plotting and visualization  
- **Seaborn** â†’ Advanced and aesthetic statistical plots  
- **Scikit-learn** â†’ Label encoding and preprocessing  
- **Jupyter Notebook** â†’ Documentation and execution

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights from the Titanic Dataset  

### ðŸ”¹ Survival Rate Overview  
- Around **38%** of passengers survived.  
- Survival was strongly influenced by **gender, class, and age**.  

### ðŸ”¹ Gender & Survival  
- **Females had a significantly higher survival rate** than males.  
- The **"Women and children first"** policy is clearly reflected in the data.  

### ðŸ”¹ Passenger Class (Pclass)  
- **First-class passengers** had the highest survival rate.  
- **Third-class passengers** had the lowest survival rate.  
- Indicates the impact of **social & economic factors** on survival chances.  

### ðŸ”¹ Age Factor  
- **Children (under 10 years)** had a higher chance of survival.  
- Survival probability **dropped as age increased**.  

### ðŸ”¹ Family Influence (SibSp & Parch)  
- Passengers traveling with **small families (1â€“2 members)** had better survival chances.  
- Those with **large families** faced lower chances, possibly due to evacuation difficulties.  

### ðŸ”¹ Embarked Port  
- Passengers embarking from **Cherbourg (C)** had a better survival rate than those from **Southampton (S)**.  

### ðŸ”¹ Correlation Heatmap Results  
- `Sex` (encoded as **0=female, 1=male**) had the **strongest correlation with survival**.  
- `Pclass` and `Fare` also showed **moderate influence**.  
 
 
## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion  

This project demonstrates the application of **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **data visualization** on the Titanic dataset.  
It includes **data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and insights extraction**, providing a strong foundation for understanding how data can reveal patterns and key factors influencing survival.
